            The Iron Bank was founded long before the Doom of Valyria,
            when Braavos was still a "secret city", hidden from the Valyrian Freehold.
            It was formed by successful traders and craftsmen. Its name comes from the abandoned
            iron mine in which the bank's founders placed all their funds. The mine had a single entrance,
            which they sealed with heavy gates and iron bars and protected by guards hired jointly by all the members.
            The Iron Bank has moved to new, grander quarters since that day, but the mine is still employed as a
            depository,
            as well as being a historical site of the city.
